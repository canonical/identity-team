## Context
Manager having to handle 2 teams at once, trying to streamline daily ceremony to be more efficient.

## Decision
We're going to adopt async daily messages to streamline daily ceremony while still keeping the daily meeting every day.
A message will be sent to the IAM mattermost channel every morning to remind the team to post their update.
